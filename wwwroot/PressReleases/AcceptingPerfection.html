<p>I feel as if I must once again apologise, dear friends. As you have no doubt heard, the Nobility have managed to elect us all an Emperox. While at times it felt like the longeset of shots, we may all now hold our heads up proudly, knowing that the Empire is once again with its spiritual and martial leader. As a prince of the Church, I was naturally quite preoccupied, and while I made repeated and concerted attempts to extricate myself, I was forced to put aside pen and pad and, regrettably, do some church-princing.</p>
<p>But all good things come to an end, and although it seemed impossible to some, my time with our glorious Church is no exception. With the larger organization stepping back from its pre-election stance and returning to the ecclesiastical duties that laid fallow after the removal of the Traitor of Humanity, it was readily apparent that for those of us with lingering interests in the politics of the sector, a change of venue was in order. The Trilliant Ring graciously extended an offer, which I accepted. Although I am no longer, strictly speaking, of the cloth, you can look forward to future such quasi-sermons, with all the fire and brimstone you have come to expect.</p>
<p>I have assured my current employers that the days of waxing lyrical on theological questions is behind me, but I think a small detour into that territory is in order, simply to explain the context of my thinking on this new Emperox. It is without a doubt certain that the idea of perfection is central to our Theology. When a priest expounds upon the advantages of living a Virtuous life, they do so not simply because the Sacred Texts are unified in their focus on virtue. No, it is because the ultimate aim of Virtue, the goal as it were, is to produce the most ideal Human Being possible. In living Virtuously, in adhering to the prescriptions of the Sacred Texts that God and Their Emperox they have laid before us, the mundane human is transformed into a ever-more perfect version of themselves. We become, in other words, ever-closer to the potential we were created with. Perfection, therefore, is something we should be striving for, with Virtue as a guide.</p>
<p>It is a shock, with such sound theology as our backdrop, that Vice is still allowed. I'm not talking of course of the small Vices of everyday life, nor of the petty squabbles neighbors find themselves in from time to time. Indeed, I'm not even talking strictly about the Vices anymore. Freed of my ecclesiastical shackles, I talk of raw, muddy politics.</p>
<p>Our Emperox has allowed rebellion to foment. I was content to allow the new serf movement fermenting on the planet Ias to continue bubbling forth while I was a priest. They were after all not breaking any Virtue, nor were they exhibiting and Vice, so far as I could tell. But without the Church's hand to strike down the un-Virtuous, we must now all beat our plow-shares back into swords once more and deal with the situation. They claim to be of all and of none, &quot;the rising tide&quot; of public opinion. Do they forget who they are? Do they forget their place? They claim to be leading the Sector into a new direction, one of increased franchise and the rights of the serf. Did they not go to school? Were their priests negligent buffoons? It boggles the mind that any loyal Imperial Citizen could join such an organization.</p>
<p>Pelax, you may say. They were out in the middle of nowhere! They were isolated. They don't know any better. As if that is an excuse for rebellion, but let us entertain the notion for a moment. We have been here before, as if anyone could forget the events of the past year. Only recently the bleating sheep of the formerly great House Vela beat the same drum of democracy, sufferage and the rights of the Serf, whatever that is supposed to mean. And look where it got them. Burned to ash and scattered to the winds, bereft of hom and refuge, stripped of title and land and purpose. Now these rebels, these ingrates, apply the same logic once more, the hydra growing yet another head.</p>
<p>All of this could be solved if these sheep and their champions had heeded the lessons of their youth, in the pursuit of perfection. The Chuch provided the perfect example befre their departure. They excised the cancerous mass of the Unified People's Collective and their stooges in House Vela from the heart of the Empire, ending an existential threat that could have wiped out humanity as the Alien menace once more swept through our lands to burn and pillage. The Empire was made more perfect, not by a little but by bounds. Yet these small-minded simpletons pine and complain, wishing for the return of division, strife, and war. Accept the perfection that has been given to you, sinners of Ias, or your time may come.</p>
<p>As the stormclouds grow deeper my friends, let us have hope. Some great and noble Citizens may rise to beat back this growing threat, rise to the occasion, that we may all be better for it.</p>
