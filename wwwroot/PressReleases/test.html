                    <li>There is one God, the Ever-All, the Light of the Void, the Creator of Humanity.</li>
                    <li>God’s first gift to Humanity is the Virtues: Faith, Propriety, Justice, Fortitude, Wisdom,
                        Temperance, Diligence, Charity, Integrity, and Hope.</li>
                    <li>God created Humanity to rule the Universe as They rule the Heavens.</li>
                    <li>To ensure Humanity thrives, God sends their Emissary, the Emperox, to guide and shepherd their
                        children.</li>
                    <li>Every human has, inside their hearts, the ten Virtues and ten <span class="vice">Vices.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>The net degree to which one is promoted by an individual’s actions over the other determines
                        your rebirth in the next life. Virtuous serfs may be reborn as nobles. Virtuous nobles may be
                        reborn as more powerful nobles. Virtuous powerful nobles may be reborn as the Emperox.
                        Similarly, the <span class="vice">Vices.</span></li>
                    <li>The Emperox is not Divine. They are a divinely appointed ruler, commanded by Heaven to rule over
                        their subjects in Virtue.</li>
                    <li>There are Ten Holy Branches, with Ten Exarchs, to fulfill the Holy Mission of the High Church.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is a Chain of Being, and it cannot be altered. God rules over all of creation. The Emperox
                        rules over Humanity. The Nobility rules over the Serf. Humanity, led by the Emperox, rules over
                        nature.</li>
                    <li>The alien, the synthetic, and the other animals cannot be a part of the communion of man.</li>
