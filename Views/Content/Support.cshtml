        <p >Please take a moment and consider supporting the site developers. It takes a great deal of time and effort to put together a public website, not to mention hosting and DNS costs. Anything donated goes directly toward keeping the site looking great
            and frequently updated.</p>
        <p >Thanks!</p>
